          <p>
              I'm a software engineer, currently working at <a href="https://www.kubecost.com/" target="_blank">Kubecost</a>.

          <h4>Projects</h5>
	  		  <p>
              Teemo Tool - <a href="https://github.com/michaelmdresser/teemo-tool">Code</a>
              <br>
              A small Clojure codebase to track betting activity on the Salty Teemo stream. Expanded to include a crawler for the Riot API which was mostly an excuse to learn more Clojure (which I did, transducers are super cool).
          </p>
			    <p>
              <a href="https://michaeldresser.io/dm-dashboard">DM Dashboard</a> - <a href="https://github.com/michaelmdresser/dm-dashboard">Code</a>
              <br>
              I DMed a couple of DnD campaigns and had some trouble keeping track of large fights. While certainly not complete, this tool helped me keep track of turns and roll initiative for large numbers of monsters quickly.
          </p>
          <p>
              SchemeInterp - <a href="https://github.com/michaelmdresser/schemeinterp">Code</a>
              <br>
              I wanted to try writing an interpreter for Scheme in Go. This was the result. It doesn't support many language features but was an interesting experience nonetheless. Would not recommend writing interpreters in Go, I would much prefer a more powerful type system.
          </p>
          <p>
              <a href="https://michaeldresser.io/bahoth-stats">Betrayal at House on the Hill stat tracking</a> - <a href="https://github.com/michaelmdresser/bahoth-stats">Code</a>
              <br>
              I played several games of Betrayal at House on the Hill and found the physical stat trackers provided with the game to be poorly constructed and easy to lose your place with. I made the site in a fit of inspiration and used it a few times to reasonable effect. It's an ugly site that could do with many visual and functional improvements, but it works okay.
          </p>
          <p>
              <a href="https://michaeldresser.io/elm-obama">Elm Obama</a> - <a href="https://github.com/michaelmdresser/elm-talk-to-obama">Code</a>
              <br>
              I wanted to try Elm while at a short hackathon a while back, and settled on creating a frontend for an <a href="https://github.com/krrishd/talk-to-obama">old hackathon project</a> I worked on with some college friends.
          </p>

					<h4>Personal Interests</h5>
						<p>
							I suppose I would call myself a fountain pen enthusiast, meaning I collect (and use!) all sorts of different fountain pens.
						</p>

						<p>
							  I primarily read fantasy and science fiction, a few favorites being (in no particular order):
                <ul>
                    <li><cite>The Stormlight Archive</cite> by Brandon Sanderson</li>
                    <li><cite>The Lord of the Rings</cite> by J.R.R. Tolkien</li>
                    <li><cite>Dune</cite> by Frank Herbert</li>
                    <li><cite>The Kingkiller Chronicle</cite> by Patrick Rothfuss</li>
                    <li><cite>Tigana</cite> by Guy Gavriel Kay</li>
                    <li><cite>The Powder Mage Trilogy</cite> by Brian McClellan.</li>
                </ul>
						</p>

						<p>
							I enjoy messing with both computer hardware and software, which sometimes is a lot more time-consuming than I wish it was. It does, however, mean that I've built several computers and have reasonable Google-fu.
						</p>
