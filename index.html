  <h3>Michael Dresser</h3>
  <p>I'm a software engineer, currently working on <a href=

  <h4>Projects</h4>
  <p><a href=
  "https://michaeldresser.io/teemo-tool-site-standalone/">Teemo
  Tool</a> - <a href=
  "https://github.com/michaelmdresser/teemo-tool-site-standalone">Code</a><br>

  Tracks live betting activity on the <a href=
  "https://twitch.tv/saltyteemo">Salty Teemo</a> stream to help
  make more informed bets by knowing live odds during betting
  windows. Runs fully local to the browser.</p>
  <p>Teemo Tool (legacy) - <a href=
  "https://github.com/michaelmdresser/teemo-tool">Code</a><br>
  A small Clojure codebase to track betting activity on the Salty
  Teemo stream. Basis for the browser-only version, this includes a
  backend so users don't need to keep a browser tab opened.
  Deprecated to avoid hosting costs. Project includes a crawler for
  the Riot API which was mostly an excuse to learn more Clojure.
  Transducers are super cool!</p>
  <p><a href="https://michaeldresser.io/dm-dashboard">DM
  Dashboard</a> - <a href=
  "https://github.com/michaelmdresser/dm-dashboard">Code</a><br>
  I DMed a couple of DnD campaigns and had some trouble keeping
  track of large fights. While certainly not complete, this tool
  helped me keep track of turns and roll initiative for large
  numbers of monsters quickly.</p>
  <p>SchemeInterp - <a href=
  "https://github.com/michaelmdresser/schemeinterp">Code</a><br>
  I wanted to try writing an interpreter for Scheme in Go. This was
  the result. It doesn't support many language features. I would
  not recommend writing interpreters in Go; I would prefer a more
  powerful type system.</p>
  <p><a href="https://michaeldresser.io/bahoth-stats">Betrayal at
  House on the Hill stat tracking</a> - <a href=
  "https://github.com/michaelmdresser/bahoth-stats">Code</a><br>
  I played several games of Betrayal at House on the Hill and found
  the physical stat trackers provided with the game to be poorly
  constructed and easy to lose your place with. This simple site
  provides a reliable way to track stats in a browser. I made the
  site in a fit of inspiration and used it a few times to
  reasonable effect.</p>
  <p><a href="https://michaeldresser.io/elm-obama">Elm Obama</a> -
  <a href=
  "https://github.com/michaelmdresser/elm-talk-to-obama">Code</a><br>

  I wanted to try Elm while at a short hackathon a while back, and
  settled on creating a frontend for an <a href=
  "https://github.com/krrishd/talk-to-obama">old hackathon
  project</a> I worked on with some college friends.</p>
  <h4>Personal Interests</h4>
  <p>I read a lot, mostly fantasy and science fiction. A few
  favorites being (in no particular order):</p>
  <ul>
    <li><cite>The Lord of the Rings</cite> by J.R.R. Tolkien</li>
    <li><cite>Dune</cite> by Frank Herbert</li>
    <li><cite>Cordelia's Honor</cite> by Lois McMaster Bujold</li>
    <li><cite>The Stormlight Archive</cite> by Brandon
    Sanderson</li>
    <li><cite>Tigana</cite> by Guy Gavriel Kay</li>
    <li><cite>A Memory Called Empire</cite> by Arkady Martine</li>
    <li><cite>The Powder Mage Trilogy</cite> by Brian
    McClellan</li>
  </ul>
  <p></p>
  <p>I like playing with programming languages as a user and
  designer. For my undergraduate thesis, I built a probabilitistic
  programming language.</p>
  <p>I collect (and use!) all sorts of different fountain
  pens.</p><br>
